Mongoose


- There are libraries(ORM) that help us establish connection between the server/programming language and the Database(MongoDB)
- we are going to Mongoose as the library that helps for the above;
- Mongoose is not the only library, other alternatives : 
                - Mongodb client : to connect to MongoDB from nodejs
                - Sequelize : to connect to SQL Databases from nodejs;
                etc 



Mongoose 
       1. helps us to connect to MongoDB - done
       2. helps us to create the structure - 
            Model and Schema
            
            __v is automatically created by Mongoose

       3. Validation
           a. When we try to insert more fields than that are in the Schema
                No error, it'll insert only the fields that are in schema, ignores/trims extra fields
            
           b. When we try to insert less fields than that are in the Schema
               No error, data will be inserted if the missing field is not "required"
  
           c. Type : 
                It Type casts
                On successfull type cast, no error;
                when it can't type cast, error

                "22" --> 22. yes can be type caste
                "twenty one" --> 21. No;
                101 --> "101". Yes can be type casted, no error

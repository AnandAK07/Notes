Frontend

But what if you are working in a team?

So both FE and BE will start simultaneously;

first things the BE devs need to do : 
1. Decide what the schema is going to be like
2. Decide on the API endpoint names
3. Provide the API contract/API endpoints documentation to the FE;



What are we going to build?

Multi User Blog Application  - Where multiple users can come and read/create/update/delete blogs

*Backend*

API endpoints : 

POST user/signup - {email, password, name}
POST user/login - {email, password} match? token:

// protected endpoints : 

GET /notes verify the token && user_id
POST /notes/create
PATCH  /notes/edit/:blogID
DELETE /notes/delete/:blogID

Independent - users
Dependent - blogs;

1. we put user_id/email in blogs

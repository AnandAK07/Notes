Authentication - It's a process of Identifying who the user is.
                 It's more about the "identity of the user";



Authorisation - It's a process of Identifying what permissions/access does a user have and handling it.
                It's more the about the "access/permissions a user has"



Authentication  - 


                1.  POST /signup
                    request payload - {email, password}
                    ---We'll save it in the DB  ("users" collection)
                    response - "sign up successfull"


                2.  POST /login
                    request payload - {email, password}
                    --- check if both this email, password together exist in our DB/users collection;
                        If it exists ? "msg : login successfull, token : "12345" : "login failed" 

                3. GET /reports - protected endpoint
                   --- if the user is logged in(by checking if they have the token, and if the token is correct) ?
                         "here are the reports" 
                         : "login first"
How do we Identify if a user has logged in?

By giving a token - remember the Hospital or the Office example.



**Token**

1. is 12345 being sent as a same token for everyone - right thing to do?
   It's like giving a blank A4 sheet as a ID card;

2. Let's make it unique for each user
   Will Math.random() work? - No, it's psuedo random and everytime we generate, it may give a new value
   MongoDB _id - No,
   email - anyone can pass anyone's email then,
   a random unique string (from crypto, some other library) - No


   Solution : 
   The Industry solution is to use JWT (Json web token)

   JWT is used both to 
   
   1) generate the token
   2) verify the token

   *is going to create token using any of the random string algorithms 

   *it has secreate key

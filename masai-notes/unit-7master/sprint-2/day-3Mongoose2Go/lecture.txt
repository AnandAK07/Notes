Mongoose


- There are libraries that help us establish connection between the server/programming language and the Database(MongoDB)
These Libraries are also called as Object Relational Mapping (ORM) 
SQL- Sequelize
- we are going to Mongoose as the library that helps for the above;
- Mongoose is not the only library, other alternatives : 
                - Mongodb client : to connect to MongoDB from nodejs
                - Sequelize : to connect to SQL Databases from nodejs;
                etc 


Mongoose 
       1. helps us to connect to MongoDB - done
       2. helps us to create the structure -
       //{name:'adam',age:'23'}
       {
        product:'xyz',
        price:23
       }
       mongoDB is very flexible what ever we want as in 2 diff doc 
       we would want to store the data that we want to
       {email,name,password} we want
       {product,price,url} we don't want
       //


            Model and Schema
            
            __v is automatically created by Mongoose
            for a to maintain version of mongoose to keep as id

       3. Validation

       R                            NE                          MongoDB(Database)
validation       level 1            level2                      level3
        can some buypass          distructure only those      Mongoose will help us to store Only that data to store in the MongoDB
        network tab take url      fields like name age
       
       
       go postman post url 
           a. When we try to insert more fields than that are in the Schema
                No error, it'll insert only the fields that are in schema, ignores/trims extra fields
            
           b. When we try to insert less fields than that are in the Schema
               No error, data will be inserted if the missing field is not "required"
  
           c. Type : 
                It Type casts
                On successfull type cast, no error;
                when it can't type cast, error

                "22" --> 22. yes can be type caste
                "twenty one" --> 21. No;
                101 --> "101". Yes can be type casted, no error

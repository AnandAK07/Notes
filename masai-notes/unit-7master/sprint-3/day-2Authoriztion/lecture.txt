authorization:-

1] client sending a token

   --client will send in the headers and we will take it out from there
   -format  "authorization":Bearer {token};

2] making authentication middleware

    - we collect all our logic at one place 
    - we can use that collected logic as a middleware for some specific endpoints;

app.get("/lectures", authentication, function (req, res) {
  return res.send("lectures are not accesable");
});

3] storing the password

  - right now we store the password in the plain text 
    we should not do that anyone can access it.
    
        --plain text-- encrypt our password ----> ecrypted text
           sujal  --->  encrypted/key ---> xyhfg
           xyhfg ---> decrypt/key --->  sujal


  --pankaj -->encypt password  -- q5iXszxDETguqGWxMQjuTA==   --key--ankur

  --rahul ---encypt password -- UHDRjNs6fsY/5HhmxDWYdw==   --key 321


    is encryption is a reversible process? -->  yes
   
   solution is HAASHING:----
          
       password-->    cup(apple)   --> SHA1 --->  igh(juice) (db)   //sighnup
           ankur --> sha1  --> ghuyhdgdhf

         //login

                apple --->sha1 --->igh

                suraj----> e10b

                ankur--->c80e7


                ---hashing is not reversible

       -- we will hash our password before storing it to the DB. 

       package --> BCRYPT   



 **** AUTHORISATION******

     - its a process of indentifying ?what access does the user have..

     example:--
                 --->   student -->>>-not allowed to create lecture
                                     -not able to upload a lecture 
                                    - no able to update notes
                                     -not able to create assignment

                  ---->  teacher ---> - allowed to create lecture
                                     - able to upload a lecture 
                                    -able to update notes
                                     - able to create assignment     

     *role based access Control**
         steps:- 
         1] student-
         2] teacher

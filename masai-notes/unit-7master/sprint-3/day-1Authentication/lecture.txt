1] what is authentication?
   - who the user claims to be 

2] why authentication?
   - to keep track record of the data/user
   - to do further things with authorisation

3] what is the difference between authorisation and authentication?
    -     

steps in authentication:-

   /register 
        - post /register
        -{email,password}=req.body
        -stores in DB
        - respond as "registration successfull"

   /login
    - post /login
    - {email,password}=req.body
    - check if that credential is present in the DB or not.
    - if present ? "login successfull" : "login failed"


     //break til 9:03.  

   -protected endpoints

   /reports
     - email and password-- this is as good as a blank paper xxxxxx
     - token -- xxxxxx
     - email+token -- xxxxxx     
     - Math.Random()-- xxxxx

     --SOLUNTION
       - for token based approach 
       - here we will explore JWT(jsonwebtoken)  


   //frontend part

    headers:{
        Authorization:$ {token},
    }   

     1] on /loginrequest,
        -if login is succesfull ..we get the token
        - we will store that token in localstorage
        - whenever we wanted to explore and protected endpoint we will get the token from local storage. we will 
           pass the token into the headers .

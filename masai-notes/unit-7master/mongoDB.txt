7) Why MongoDB is the best NoSQL database?
MongoDB is the best NoSQL database due to the following features:

High Performance
High Availability
Easily Scalable
Rich Query Language
Document Oriented

Flexible Schema:
MongoDB is a schema-less database, allowing documents in a collection to have different fields and structures. This flexibility is useful for accommodating changes in data models without requiring a predefined schema.

Scalability: 
MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers, which enables it to handle large volumes of data and high throughput applications.

Rich Query Language: MongoDB supports a powerful query language that includes features like aggregation pipelines, text search, geospatial queries, and more.

Community Support: MongoDB has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and community-driven tools available.

dis
-Memory Usage:
 MongoDB may consume a significant amount of memory, especially when dealing with large datasets, which could lead to increased hardware requirements.
-Complexity:
While MongoDB is relatively easy to set up and use, managing a distributed MongoDB cluster can be complex, requiring careful configuration and monitoring.

~ 3 months for FE
But just 3 weeks/sprints for BE?


BE -> Server + Database (MongoDB)

   -> Server -> it's just another computer which serves;

     
    Customer ---> requesting  Salt ---> Server/Waiter should serve the salt;
    Customer ---> requesting  Sugar ---> Server/Waiter should serve the sugar;

In the case of the restaurant waiter, it's a human with brain to process the request and serve approproiately

But in the case of our computer server, we need to program the computer so that :
if the request is for salt, respond with salt and so on;
if the request is for /lectures, it should respond with lectures;
/assignments -> assignments;


BE -> Server + Database (MongoDB)

   -> Server -> it's just another computer which serves;
   -> Server side programming language (SSPL) + Framework/Library 
   -> Java + spring/springboot
   -> Python + Flask/Django
   -> Javascript + Express
   -> PHP + Laravel

   Python(X amount of time for learing this) + Django (Y amount of time) --> X + y time
   Java (X) + springboot(Y) ---> X + Y;
   Javascript (X) + Express(Y) ---> X + Y; We have already spent X time before unit 7, so what's left is Y amount of time;


MERN 
You have already learnt react

NEM is left;

N - Node

What exactly is Node?

Javascript was meant only to run on the browser
HTML, CSS, Javascript +  A SSPL + frameworks

Ryan Dahl - why not make Javascript run outside the browser?
- came up with Node -> It helps run Javascript outside the browser;

**Node - It's just a runtime environment to run Javascript outside the browser**

If we want to swim - we require an environment where we can swim like beach, river -> swimming pool(swimtime environment)

Node -> JS Engine + a few more things 
     -> Chrome(V8 engine) 
     -> Mozilla firefox(spiderMonkey)


Node -> V8 engine + a few more things;


Node REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

Modules

Import and Export

ESM way of importing exporting. ES6 came in 2015,node was created in 2009 
   import x from y;
   export deafult x;

CJS way of importing exporting
   var x = require(y)
   module.exports = x
 
Modules : 
1. Custom modules - where we create our own modules, write our own logic etc. Eg. calc.js;
2. Node inbuilt modules - which are already present in node. Eg. OS,
         https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/
3. External modules - some other devs wrote the code and published it online for us to use - npm packages
         There are close to ~ 13 lakh package

         Example : is-even, qrcode

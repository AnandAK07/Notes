we need to program our computer for it to serve appropriate response based on the request

In general, apart from it being the inbuilt module of node : 

HTTP - Hyper text transfer protocol

Protocol - it's a set of things/rules which are agreed upon;

HTTP verbs/methods

**Benchmarking**
If we want to benchmark(measure the maximum capacity) of our server, we can do that;

We can use "autocannon" package;


npx autocannon url
npx autocannon http://localhost:8000/lectures

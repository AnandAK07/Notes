Database - Database management system?

What :  
        It's a software which is optimised for performing the CRUD operations on the data;

        You can run this software on your computer locally or on a computer you rent online (cloud)

        delete()
        modify(23, {price : 500})

        We just need to call/write a particular query and this software takes care of doing the C/R/U/D operation as per the query;


Why do we need a database? 
        - when we can store data in files like json for example, why do we need something like a database?

        If I have 10,000 products in my data.json, and if I want to modify the 5th product


        CRUD operations is what happen on data;

        To perform CRUD operations on data stored in data.json is costly(in terms of time, processing - efficiency)



Types of Databases : 

1. SQL databases;
                Examples : mssql, postgresql
                Data is stored in the format of -  Tables, rows and columns;

                Very structured format

                SQL - Structured query language;

2. No SQL Databases;
                Examples : MongoDB;

                {
                    id : 3,
                    name : shoes,
                    brand : bata,
                    price : 1000,
                    category : footwear
                    color : black,
                    size : 10
                },
                {
                    id : 4,
                    name : cup,
                    price : 250
                },
                {
                    id : 7,
                    name : router_ups
                },
                {
                    id : 999,
                    name : "...",
                    origin : India
                }


3. Key-value databases;
                Examples : local storage, Redis
                Mostly used for caching etc;


4. Graph databases : 





What is better - SQL or NoSQL?
It depends;



MongoDB - M of the MERN stack;

Why MongoDB?
- It's very easy to learn especially for those who are used to Javascript
- Most startups tend to use MongoDB
- Once we learn MongoDB, it's easier to learn SQL Database as well;

Structure in MongoDB

            Databases
                        - Collections
                                        - documents


            
            ptweb16
                        - students collection
                                                - {
                                                    name : "Arnab",
                                                    city : "pune"
                                                },
                                                {
                                                    name : "Swati",
                                                    city : "blr"
                                                }


                        - instructors collection
                                                - {
                                                    name : "Rahul",
                                                    stack : "React"
                                                }
                                                {
                                                    name : "Nihal",
                                                    stack : "BE"
                                                }


                        - ops team collection



Database
    - Collections
        - documents;


1. We made an account on MongoDB Atlas - cloud version of MongoDB
2. We installed MongoDB Compass (GUI) tool which will help us interact with our data;
  ^ this tool also has a terminal - Mongo shell which we'll be using to write the queries;




db - database

cls - for clearing the terminal


1. show dbs

2. use ptweb16 - to create the database
   use db_name;

    if we don't have a database,it'll create one 
    if we have one, it'll use that;

3. show collections - to see the existing collections in our db

4. db - to see the current db we are in

5. db.createCollection("collection_name") - creates a collection


db.collection_name.C/R/U/D

6. To *READ* the documents in a collection 
    db.collection_name.find({})

    db.collection_name.findOne({}) - returns one document, the first one which it finds matching the criteria;

7. To *CREATE* the documents in a collection
    db.collection_name.insertOne()


    _id is automatically generated by MongoDB and it is random;
    _id has a lot of significance in MongoDB

    Homework - Find out what does a MongoDB _id consists of?


    db.collection_name.insertMany([{},{}])
    ^ to insert multiple documents


8. To *DELETE* a document

    db.collection_name.deleteOne({}) - delete the first document matching the criteria
    db.collection_name.deleteMany({}) - deletes all the documents that match the criteria


9. To *Update* a document

    db.collection_name.updateOne({matching critiera}, {$set : {updated data}}) - Updates the first document that matches the criteria;

    db.users.updateOne({name : "Bob"}, {$set : {city : "pune"}})

    db.collection_name.updateMany({}, {}) - Updates all the documents that matches the criteria;
